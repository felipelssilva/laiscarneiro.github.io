# About me

I'm an Environmental Engineer and Ph.D. student in Ecology and Conservation at the Federal University of Paraná State. My research focuses on the impacts of non-native species in protected areas. I also investigate spatiotemporal patterns of invasive species, particularly in the neotropical region.
